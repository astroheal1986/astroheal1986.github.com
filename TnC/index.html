				The App is part of a service designed to enable registered users to Geo Tag location of the self or people nearby with photo of location and type of Geo Tag such as Quarantine or tested Positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus2(<strong>Covid-19</strong>). The Geo Tags created by tapping on the Map screen will be visible to any registered user within nearby area. When the app is installed it makes use of the GPS of the mobile device to send the current location to the server and then fetch nearby Geo Tags which are shown in different colours.
